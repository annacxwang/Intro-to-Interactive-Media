Sorry I was stuck on the project's parts and didn't plan enough time to finish the post. Will update post tonight.


Whenever it comes to any technology products, funcionality and design are always both important criterias for me to choose any products. Sometimes I even feel like I put too much emphasize on appearance of the products. For example, when buying a pair of bluetooth earphones, despite similar basic functionalities they provide, I purchased ones with cuter design but almost 1.5 times the price of the others. I think nowadays, most young people to some extent consider these kind of "wearable" technology as both utility and accessory. We all want to look different, and these products are included as ways of self expression.
