Personally, I always feel that our way of interacting with laptops today is way too limited since we mainly just use our fingers to type on keyboard or use a mouse/ trackpad. There is still great potential in developing ways to interact with computers with other parts of our body which might enhance not only type of user input we can provide to the computers but also our experience with these interaction as it will be more fun if we are not limited to use our fingers.
In this reading, it mentioned Myron Krueger’s quote that “entire human body ought to have a role in our interactions with computers” which I appreciate very much. Computer vision is a field where user input by entire human body can be much more preferred than input merely with keyboard and mouse. In addition, we can make our entire body more engaged with the interaction in computer vision and many new types of art forms can be introduced.
Towards the end of the paper, the author mentioned the importance of physical environment to computer vision installations: “In many cases, a cleverly designed physical environment can permit the tracking of phenomena that might otherwise require much more sophisticated software.” I think this is a great point to take into consideration as sometimes I find myself too immersed with coding and think primarily about fixing any problem by adjusting my code but neglecting the possibility to have a simple fix by changing a project’s physical location / structure etc. For example, for my midterm project (the “autonomous” vehicle) I spent a long time trying to figure out a code to make the motor spin in the opposite direction not realizing a better choice was to simply attach the motor differently.
