As one who was born in the very end of 20th century China, I find my generation growing up with the digital transformation of everyday lives. We are all witnesses for the lifestyle switch starting from the beginning of the 21st century. 
I do believe that computing and computers have enhanced our lives and enabled us to do things much more efficiently. They have also saved us time doing very redundant jobs. In the same way, they might have denied us the opportunity to exercise doing stuff without their help. One simple example will be that I used to be good at calculation in my head back in high school since we are not allowed to use laptops or any electronic devices inside classrooms but not any more after I came to college.
I don't know if computing make me a better person as I can't imagine myself living without electronic devices now.I sometimes feel like I might have spent too much time in front of my laptop screen : I study and take notes with it; I browse for information and submit applications and other forms through it; I watch leisure videos and listen to music with it. With the help of my laptop, I can be totally entertained and productive without engaging in any form of socializing. It is true that we can choose not to use our laptops unless absolutely necessary, but that will be too intentional and won't be the normal daily life for the majority of college students nowadays.The time that computers have saved for us might be "wasted" again doing random stuff such as watching YouTube videos ( some might not agree with this considered wasting time).
I would like to say that it is no doubt we are gaining a lot from computing, but we might be losing as much without even realizing it. In the era of computing, we might need to balance physical life and digital life to avoid being too immersed with the digital world.
