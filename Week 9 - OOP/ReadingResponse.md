Whenever it comes to any technology products, funcionality and design are always both important criterias for me to choose any products. Sometimes I even feel like I put too much emphasize on appearance of the products. For example, when buying a pair of bluetooth earphones, despite similar basic functionalities they provide, I purchased ones with cuter design but almost 1.5 times the price of the others. I think nowadays, most young people to some extent consider these kind of "wearable" technology as both utility and accessory. We all want to look different, and these products are included as ways of self expression.

That being said, I feel like devices like hearing aid can also become common and included as "normal" functional accesories just like glasses. I wonder how it might change our perceptions of wearing hearing aid if we can introduce devices to enhance hearing for people who don't think they are "disabled" like me. When wearing hearing aid become a common and usual practice, more fashinable hearing aid may even become fashionable and a way of self expression.
